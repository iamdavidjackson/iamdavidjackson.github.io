Ok lets test the age old theory that having multiple HTTP requests to get Javascript is adverse to loading times.  Obviously it is better to download a single file over multiple files however what I'm wondering is, how much better?  Are we killing ourselves trying to reduce HTTP requests when there is no benefit or are we saving the world from certain destruction?  Lets have a go shall we?
